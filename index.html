                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>My name is James Rodriguez Jr. Born August 17, 1989, in St. Louis, Mo. I grew up in University City. A central county located at the boarder of St. Louis city and county. I'm the youngest of three, and the only boy.
                           I'm a passionate tech geek who loves music, video games, animals, sleeping, reading, learning new things, writing, and anime. I don't really have one genre of music I like more than another, but I do like listening to music that has lyrics I can understand and have a meaningful message.
                           I prefer first person shooter(FPS), third person shooters(TPS), and MMORPGs, but I play a little bit of everything. My all time favorite game would be the entire Metal Gear series. Most of the reading I enjoy is either science and tech articles or a good manga. However, give me a good fiction novel and I'm a happy camper.
                           When I'm not being a reclusive home body, I love to go fishing, camping, swimming, kite flying, or just chill at a nice park. Some of the people I most admire are my parents, grandparents, sisters, my uncle Rod, my aunt Niambi, Miles Davis, Carlos Santana, Bill Gates, Hideo Kojima (the creator of the Metal Gear games), Nikola Tesla, Malcolm X, Tupac, and my lovely fiancee LaToya.
                           My goal career goal is to eventually become a software engineer. My end game is to one day have my very own software development firm.</p>

                            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                            <p>So what made me decide to go into software development? 
                                <br><br>My story starts when I was 5 years old. My uncle was in town visiting from Chicago. He came over to our house with a big rectangular shaped cardboard box. Inside it was a custom-built PC he’d put together for us running Windows 95. I was super excited and sat there watching him as he unboxed the tower and get everything set up. As he was configuring the PC and making some final adjustments, he ended up having to open the side panel of the tower to install a standalone sound card. That’s when thing got even more exciting for me. Seeing the inside of a computer for the first time gave me a “love at first sight” feeling. I was so intrigued looking at all the components that went inside that beige/off-whitish metal case, I just knew I had to learn more about the mystery world I would later find out was computer science. However, as much as it had piqued my interest, I wouldn’t really explore this world until years later. 
                                <br>For the next several years I’d spend most of my time playing video games, playing trumpet, soccer, baseball, and trading card games. I was getting very good with most of those activities. However, I would tinker with electronics and mess around with the software occasional. Between the Age of 5 and 6, that consisted of me putting the computer in DOS mode and not knowing how to get out of it. During those early years there were times when I saw myself being a professional athlete or musician, but I hated the spotlight. For a while I even considered, since I loved music so much, why not become a producer. But, by the time I got into 6th or 7th grade, I was 100 percent certain I wanted to do something in the tech industry. I just wasn’t sure what. 
                                <br>For an 8th grade writing assignment I was tasked to write an essay on what I wanted to do as a career. During my research into the various fields of technology, I realized there were more career options than a Jack ‘n The Box menu. By the end of the assignment, I was even more confused on what path to take. So, I came up with the idea to learn and do both, and that’s what begun my journey into the world of technology and computer science.

                            <h4>My Journey</h4>
                            <p><br>While still in middle school, I started taking continuing education classes at St. Louis Community College- Florissant Valley (Flo- Valley). Over the next couple of years, I learned how the build, troubleshoot, and maintenance computers. Basically, desktop support skills, which I’d practice using fixing friends and family’s computer issues. The summer before my sophomore year, I started building a high-performance PC, which took about a year because I sadly maxed out my grandparents’ credit card unintentionally and had to wait for more funds. That same summer I had also joined the ascend teen program through the St. Louis Science Center, thanks to my guidance counselor Mr. H. The program lasted from the summer before my sophomore year until the summer of my senior year. During that time, I was on their vex robotics team as a programmer during the fall and winter, and an intern at various places during the summer. Although my job was programming, there wasn’t much programming involved. The software we used pretty much did everything and the engineer who mentored the team had did any real programming that was required. All my high school years consisted of me mostly exploring the hardware side. The closest to the software aspect I got was troubleshooting Windows operating systems. During this time, I became more interested in hardware development. Second semester of my junior year I landed a job at Radio Shack where I got more exposure to radio/cellular and networking technologies, engineering equipment, and of course tech consulting.
                               <br>Due to me neglecting school assignments and looking at having to repeat a semester, my senior year, I dropped out of high school before the second half. I instead, got my G.E.D. that spring (to “graduate on time”, so to speak). I enrolled at Flo-Valley for the 2009 spring semester the following year. My major at the time was computer engineering since I was still more interested in the hardware side. Unfortunately, I dropped out before midterm due to some financial struggles. My plan was to return when I was more financially stable. I was still working at Radio Shack, and was very good at my job, specifically selling mobile service. But I was still stuck at part time with no hope of moving up in the ranks and not making enough. I had been trying to get a job at Sprint, Verizon, or AT&T since I finished high school. I knew that they’d paid more and would offer tuition reimbursement. Plus, I figured I’d have a foot in the door to acquire job with one of those companies, pertaining to my field of study. However, that never happened at that time. Instead, I was slowly straying away from my goals, and unintentionally starting a career in sales and customer service. I ended up losing my job at Radio Shack that following December. Over the next two years I’d try my hand at selling furniture and then customer service. I didn’t necessarily forget what I wanted to do as a career, but I wasn’t studying anything new and didn’t do much freelance troubleshooting work. Therefore, allowing my existing skills to dull down.
                               <br>In 2011, while at Convergys working in a call center for their Express Scripts customer service department, I told myself that regardless of what might happen, I’d go back to school the following year. I was realizing that I was miserable about not finishing school and not being in my prefer career of choice. I ended up being terminated that August from Convergys due to a high average call handle time. After losing a third job, the second of which I was only able to hold on to for no more than 8 months, I was feed up with working. With the mobile companies still not noticing me, I decided to take a 3-year hiatus from the work force to avoid taking another job I couldn’t see myself enjoying. Doing that time with unemployment and other means of income, I was doing pretty good. I was even able to stick to my promise of returning to school fall 2012. Paid for the classes out of pocket too. This time around I changed my major to computer science. I started taking 2 classes at a time with no breaks between semesters to speed things up. However, I was really struggling the chemistry and hardware and software concepts classes I had taken fall 2013, and once again had to put a pen in it. Luckily it wouldn’t be for long. In July 2014, after years of applying, I was finally interviewed and offered a position at Sprint. It was a lot further that I wanted to travel, but I was willing to make the commute, I had a car and knew the bus route just in case I ever needed it. I didn’t expect I would need to use it thought. Unfortunately, my now fiancée got into a hit and run collision with an 18-wheeler, hours after I received the call with my job offer. 
                               <br>Nonetheless, I stuck to my goals. I took a 2-hour commute via the bus every workday. To my surprise however, public transportation wasn’t what I remembered from previous experiences. I was often late by a couple of minutes due to the bus running late. By October, I was getting fed up, so I ended up getting a new car a lot sooner that I was expecting. But what the hay, I was eventually going to need a new one anyway. I was making enough to afford a car note and still be able to do what I wanted to do. That following spring I returned to school. I retook my hardware and software concepts course and intermediate algebra. Sadly, between being often tardy when I was first hired, and fighting with highway traffic when I was finally back in my own car, I was terminated that April from Sprint. Eger to not get distracted again from school, I still managed to pass my classes. That determination I had to finish that semester though, would soon dissipate.
                               <br>By that fall I let myself get distracted all over again.  At this point I had lost another job I was only at for no more than 8 months. This time it was with the company I had been chasing for 6 years. I was still living at home with my mom and stepdad, and with LaToya my now fiancée. This didn’t sit right with me. I also felt like should have accomplished something at this point as well in my life, at least be in my own house. Instead I was a 26-year-old failure. That type of thinking caused me to lose that drive and determination all over again. That fall semester I ended up withdrawing from my classes to avoid failing those classes and looked for another job. By that January, I was unsuccessful in getting a new job. But with the fear of putting school off again and this time not returning, I re-enrolled in the two classes I withdrew from. More so, I forced myself into doing it knowing my mind was not mentally ready. I did horribly that semester. At this point I was also no longer able to continue paying for courses. So, I had to hang up attempting to continue pursuing my degree in computer science. But I promised myself, I’d continue learning on my own until I could once again resume my studies. Although, down and out about everything, I was still focused on keeping that promise.
                               <br>After a week of feeling depressed, I started looking at alternative routes to becoming an IT professional. I remembered a few years back, my uncle told me that there were other ways besides college to get into my desired field of choice. It all just depended on what I wanted to do. Since I was still interested in doing any and everything, I search for free online programming tutorials as well as a search for IT certifications. After spending hours researching what felt like unlimited options of languages and IT certifications accepted in the industry, I sat down and wrote out a plan. The plan consisted of an ordered list of various topics and programming languages to learn. To get into an IT career quickly, I’d learn and refresh on what I needed to get my CompTIA A+ and network+ certifications. While prepping for these certifications, I’d start learning python first. Then once I was done, JavaScript, C#, Java, and so forth, until I had learned every language in the top 10, I was seeing on everyone’s list. This gave me hope, and I was no longer upset with how miserable I did in school. That April 2016, I ended getting a job as a Samsung experience consultant. I was extremely excited. It was part time, which gave me free time to still pursue my certifications and learn the programming languages I wanted to learn. I was also excited because I was going to be selling a brand of electronics I love. Plus, with me working again, my fiancée and I were finally making enough again to finally move into our own place.
                               <br>Over the next several months I was doing good with my studies. I didn’t get as much daily studying done as I wanted to, but I would try to get at least an hour a day. While at work, I had apps like “SoloLearn” for programming and “CompTIA Training” for certification training. With my job, I was able to utilize some of my troubleshooting skills. November 2016 my fiancée and I finally moved into our own apartment. I ended up taking a break from learning with everything going on, and with no ideal study setup in the apartment I had no choice. The issue was, what was supposed to be a 3-month break, turned into a year and 6 months. A few months after we had moved, we hit another financial snag. So, I had to shift gears and look for a full-time job. I ended up getting hired on as a sales consultant at AT&T. It was great getting a job for another one of the 3 wireless providers I had been attempting to get hired at. My plan was the same as my plan at Sprint. But instead of returning to college, my focus was to resume studying for my A+ and Network+ certifications since I was now making enough to pay for them. However, with such an inconsistent demanding schedule, I found that to be very difficult to do. My time at AT&T was short lived, due to my negligence in reporting inaccurate clock-ins. After 1 year and 11 months I was once again jobless.
                               <br>Luckily, I was able to draw unemployment, while looking for another job. It was around this time I knew I was done with sales jobs. After learning the basics of python prior to getting a job as a Samsung experience consultant, I was also starting to notice I was becoming more interested in software development. However, I didn’t feel as confident in programming as I still felt with hardware and troubleshooting. But I assumed for me to even get a job in IT support, I’d still need at least one of the certifications I was after. So, I decided to use the opportunity to attempt to prep for the A+ exam again while learning more python. But I ended up letting myself derail from that plan to participate in a Destiny 2 amateur competition. One day in October 2018, a friend of mine stopped by, and we were talking about my current situation. She had mention there was a free training program that teaches programming called Launch Code. I had heard of this program before but didn’t know they offered free training and help with job placement. After I googled searched launch code and found out they were about to start taking application for their winter 2018 LC101 course, I figured I’d apply. The deadline was the end of November, since I was still in a 4-month long Destiny 2 marathon competition, I figured I’d finish the competition, and the week of Thanksgiving during the break of the competition, I’d apply for the course. 
                               <br>November 20th came around and I wasted no time. I woke up and started applying for the Launch Code LC101 course. During this process, I was ambushed with an assessment test I was not mentally prepared to take. I didn’t do so well, but I still had faith that I still had a chance. After completing the application and assessment, I still had to wait until December 21st to know if I was accepted or not. However, the thought of taking the course excited me and gave me some motivation to refresh my python skills. For the rest of that week I retook the Microsoft Virtual Academy “Introduction to Programming- Python” course. Once the week was out, the competition resumed. This competition was non-stop, even a minute away from the game would cause a player to go from top 20 to rank 100. I held my own though, and consistently stayed in the top 50 out of 5000. But even with me committing 18 hours of game play a day, I still just could not keep up with those who were consistently in the top 10. Plus, I was starting to think about my life outside of this competition and wanting to resume my python training. The last week of the competition came the week of December 15th. At this point I told myself that if I wasn’t in the top 10 within the first 48 hours, I would withdraw and start focusing on studying and job hunting. During the first 48 hours, I kept hovering in the top 20, unable to move pass rank 12. So, I stuck to my word, and pulled out of the competition, and resumed life. 
                               <br>The morning of December 21st came, and I quickly reach for my phone to check my email to see if I was accepted into the LC101 course. Sadly, I was not accepted. I was so disappointed, I lost some of my motivation to continue my studying. But I didn’t stop completely. I spent most of my time searching for work, studying my A+ exam prep book, and reading python tutorials. February 13th, I got an email from Launch Code saying they were taking applications for their spring 2019 LC101 course. With having two interviews that day, I applied for the course the following day. Then that following Friday, I received a call from one of the companies I interviewed for that week. It was a job offer for a sales position with Fields Data Recovery. As much as I didn’t want to take another sales job, I took it anyway with plans to eventually transition to their engineering department. My motivation had skyrocketed all over again, and I felt like things were starting to go right for me. March 27th came around and I received an email from Launch Code stating that I didn’t get accepted again. I was a little discouraged, but I told myself I’d keep trying, and kept an eye out for the next chance. I decided to just make do for now with current my position as an enquiry handler at Fields Data Recovery while occasionally reading and studying programming and A+ exam topics. 
                               <br>The following month after listening to a call of mine, my supervisor saw exactly how knowledgeable I was with computer technology and pushed to get me into the engineering department. Since there was an opening, a couple of weeks later I was offered the position within the company as a Pre-Diagnostics Team member (PDT) in the engineering department. I’d never forget it; it was April 26th. I was so happy and felt accomplished after all these years finally stepping out of sales and into something related to my field of study. Although it was a pay cut since there was no bonuses like with my current position, I didn’t care. I figured, if I was in a position doing something I was passionate about, the amount of money I was being paid didn’t matter to me. The following 7 weeks, I remember feeling complete, and at peace. I was learning a lot about how to repair damage storage devices long enough to attempt to recover the data, imaging drives for lost deleted data, and more. Then there was the bonus of no longer being at the mercy of the client, I was in complete control of my performance. I was always one of the first to arrive and last to leave. But this didn’t last long. 
                               <br>By the end of May, we had seen a decrease in traffic. Apparently, the company generated close to 80% of their clients through Google’s advertisement services, and with changes google made in a recent update, were unable to advertise at the time via Google ads. With the company not being able to stay afloat at the current operating cost, an announcement was made that they were going to have to do layoffs. Thanks to having 2 skill traits, sales and tech, I was able to stay on at Fields. I was transferred to the Account manager sales team. This was the team that sales the recovery service once the devices came in and had been diagnosed. I was a little sad about not being able to stay on as an engineer, but I expected it. I was just happy to not have to go through the job-hunting process again. I also felt a little loyal to the company, since they gave me the chance I had been looking for all these years. In my mind, I figured I’d help in rebuilding the company in anyway I could, using which ever skill set they needed. However, not long after, I started feeling differently. One day in mid-June, my mom sent me a picture with a message. It was a picture of a Launch Code flyer posted on a wall at her job, announcing openings for their LC101 course starting in August. Not having much confidence that I would get accepted, this time around, I still wanted to try again. I ended up losing my job on July 19th, due to low sales performance. I really didn’t know how to feel about this one, because I never lost a job for sales performance. But I was back at it again, searching for a job. At this moment I started really taking my application seriously, praying that I get accepted. 
                               <br>The following week I went to check to status of my application and found out that there was a delay in decisions due to so many applications. Staying true to not wanting another sales job I applied for various IT support positions, prepared for interviews questions, and stalked my inbox for updates on my application for Launch Code LC101. On August 1st, I received an acceptance email from Launch Code. A couple of days later I was also contacted by Amazon for an interview for an IT support technician position. I did great for the on-demand video interview, but sadly, tanked on the in-person interview I had August 13th. However, I wasn’t too upset, because that past Monday, August 12, I started my first big step into the world of software development and continuing my journey on along the path I sat out for all those years ago. Although, I am still unemployed, and prefer to work, I’m content with not getting the jobs I applied for after parting ways with Fields Data Recovery. The LC101 program is great, but it is kind of a fast peace course. And from my experience, I’m just not good at balancing things to have kept up in class. So, here I am fully committed to something I enjoy and am passionate about and marking a new chapter in my life. I don’t know exactly where this path will lead me, but I’ll keep treading along to find out. And so, the journey continues…

                            <h5>Reflection</h5>
                            <p><br>Reflecting on my journey so far, due to events mentioned and events I didn’t mention, I allowed myself to get distracted and stray away from my chosen path. However, I can no longer allow myself to do this. I no longer see myself as a failure or unsuccessful. In programming we are taught that it is good to get errors in our code because it gives us the opportunity to learn and grow to become better programmers. Well life works the same, experiencing and learning from our mistakes helps us become better people in both our personal and professional lives. I’ve learned from my choices and mistakes, and I’ve embraced them. Learning from my life lessons is a form of success on its own. Although I couldn’t see the good at the time, I’ve realized had my journey been any different, I wouldn’t have learned new viable skills that I can use in any industry. I wouldn’t have met the awesome people I have over the years, like my beloved fiancée, or the great people at Launch Code. And most of all, I wouldn’t have evolved. I was only in school for brief moments, but I learned a lot within those short times. I believe had it not been for my hardware and software concepts class I still wouldn’t have realized the specific path in technology I wanted to take. Over these years I’ve also learned my strengths and weakness, and how to work around my weakness when I can’t turn them into strengths. 
                            <br>I’m not saying that going forward, I’d no longer make mistakes or not feel discouraged when things don’t happen the way I want them to. But I know life never happens the way we want it to. So, when I do feel discouraged and things don’t go accordingly, I just do as I did before, come up with a new plan and keep pushing towards my goals. I still have a long road ahead of me, and I’m not sure how long it’ll take me to cross a checkpoint or even the finish line. However, I know now that it’s not about how quickly we tread through our chosen paths, it’s about the journey along that path and reaching the goal itself.

                            <h6>My Advice- The biggest lesson I've learned</h6>
                            <p><br>Life’s very unpredictable, it’s full of ups, downs, twist, and turns. However, we must not let “in the moment” negative feelings cause us to get distracted, discouraged, or stray away from our goals and dreams. We must stay consistent and persistent in whatever it is we sat out to do. I’ve always heard if you want to make God laugh, then make a plan. But to go through life without a plan will drive a person insane. So, we always want to plan, but just be ready to make adjustments. </p>
